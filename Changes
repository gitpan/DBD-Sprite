	  allowing more than 1 argument for functions, and minor bug 
	  which stripped wild-card chars from function results in "LIKE" 
	  expressions.
0.15  Thu Nov 02
	- Fix bug that caused question marks in bound parameter values to be 
	  treated as additional parameters.
0.16  Thu Dec 21
	- Fixed bug which would not allow lower-case versions of the "AND" and 
	  "OR" operators.  Also made field-names used as right-values return 
	  the appropriate value they represent rather than just a literal 
	  string of the field name, ie. "update table set FIELD1 = FIELD2" 
	  should now work properly instead of setting FIELD1 to "FIELD2" in 
	  every record of "table".
0.17  Fri Mar 09
	- Fixed bug where types not returned for cursor after update, 
	  Fixed bug where table names not returned if space appeared after 
	  "table_name"?
	- Fixed bug in "makesdb.pl" -- was encrypting wrong argument.
0.18  Wed Mar 13
	- Changed comparisens of literal data with "CHAR" fields to first 
	  pad the literal with appropriate spaces so that eqality tests would 
	  pass (to work like Oracle and the way DBIx-Recordset expects).
	  Also added new option "StrictCharComp" to force the old behavior.
	- Fixed bug that occasionally inserted a "0" instead of "" in numeric 
	  fields when inserting NULL.  To get the proper "old" behavior, 
	  specify a default of zero for each numeric field, ie.
	  "NUMFIELD=NUMBER=0" in the top line of your Sprite table files.
	- Added some code to check syntax of "where" clauses. (for DBIx-
	  Recordset.
	- Fixed a couple of other small bugs that DBIx-Recordset tests found.
0.19  Wed Mar 21
	- Fixed problem seeing all Windows file-names due to case-insensitivity 
	  in Windows.
0.20  Fri Aug 15
	- Fixed bug involving autocommit on statements containing "select" in data. 
	  Caught by Simon Elliott, Thanks!  Also fixed several other minor glitches.
	- Fixed bug forbidding sequence files in mixed-case directories unless 
	  CaseTableNames was set (CaseTableNames only applies to the file-name).
	  Also added code to display "$@" and "$?" in the error details message on 
	  -511 errors (could not [over]write file).
